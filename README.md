## Design

#### Wireframes
I started the design process by sketching down my idea to detemine which layout style I thought would work best. I then used the online wireframe website, Basamiq, to create the wireframes which I would work off throughout the project.

#### Colour Scheme
The colour palette was created keeping in mind the name and location of the book club being named “Harbour Book Club” and located in a pub based in a marina. The colours are also not too bright which promotes a relaxing environment for reading.

I have used a different colour backgrounds to define each section.

The main colours are:

#### Typography

I used the same font throughout the site in order to create continuity and to keep the site looking simple and clean. After trying our different fonts, I decided to go with Roboto and used a lighter font weight as I felt it gave the site a classier finish.
