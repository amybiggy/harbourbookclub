### Communication

The website is designed so that anyone would be able to access it and easily identify the information they are looking for. All pages are clearly labelled with the information you would find on there, including the Sign Up button and contact us form.

## Design

#### Wireframes

I started the design process by sketching down my idea to detemine which layout style I thought would work best. I then used the online wireframe website, Basamiq, to create the wireframes which I would work off throughout the project.

#### Colour Scheme

The colour palette was created keeping in mind the name and location of the book club being named “Harbour Book Club” and located in a pub based in a marina. The colours are also not too bright which promotes a relaxing environment for reading.

I have used a different colour backgrounds to define each section.

The main colours are:

#### Typography

I used the same font throughout the site in order to create continuity and to keep the site looking simple and clean. After trying our different fonts, I decided to go with Roboto and used a lighter font weight as I felt it gave the site a classier finish.

## Testing

### Browser Testing

I checked my webpage against the 3 top browsers; Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Firefox. I checked the webpage for 3 different screen sizes - PC/Laptop, iPad and mobile device

| Browser        | Screen Size |                                                        Image |
| -------------- | :---------: | -----------------------------------------------------------: |

## Code Validation

### HTML and CSS Testing

Once I had finished creating the webpage I ran the code through a HTML and CSS validator to make sure it was correct

## Accessability Testing

I used (pagespeed.web.dev) to check the accessability of my website to check that everything was completely accessible

## Deployment

## Technologies Used

I used a variety of technologies throughout the project.

- I used HTML and CSS to create and style the website
