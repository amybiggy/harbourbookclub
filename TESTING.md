## Testing

### Browser Testing

I checked my webpage against the 3 top browsers; Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Firefox. I checked the webpage for 3 different screen sizes - PC/Laptop, iPad and mobile device

### HTML and CSS Validation

Once I had finished creating the webpage I ran the code through a HTML and CSS validator to make sure it was correct

### Accessability Testing

I used (pagespeed.web.dev) to check the accessability of my website to check that everything was completely accessible

### Bugs Discovered

When I was checking whether my website was responsive on different screen sizes, I doscovered that anything smaller than a laptop wouldn't show the map or contact form correct so I added in media queries to my CSS and this fixed the issue.

I was having an issue with the text in my header overflowing into the section below due to the vh size I had set on the header image. I changed this size and made it slightly larger which fixed the issue

When viewing my website on smaller screens I was having an issue with the navbar. It was opening fine, but wouldn't collapse back again. I watched a video on youtube and realised that I had the incorrect scripts in my html. I changed these for the correct one and it fixed the issue.

### Peer Review

I submitted my project for review by my peers using the Slack channel and received some positive and contrusctive criticism which I took on board. I would also like to thank my sister who has also provided some points for me to review in order to improve the overall look of my website.
